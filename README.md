# Blaseball Peanut Clicker
#### Eat all the peanuts without the pesky manual labour! 


This was made due to it taking three seconds to eat just one peanut and I had roughly 19000 of them, taking me 15.83 hours to eat them all, so I created this and left it on in the background instead.

## Prerequisites
Node v16.3.0 and npm 7.17.0

## Install and Running Steps
* Rename `auth-format.json` to `auth.json` and put in your username and password in the empty quotes.
* In the command line, navigate to the folder and run `npm i` to install the application,
* Run `node app.js` to start it!

I hope you like this useless tool, I just wanted to see if something happened if you ate a certain amount.
